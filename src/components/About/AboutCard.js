            Hi everyone, I'm <span className="purple">Charan Yarra </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.</span>
            <br />
            I currently work in the Program Operations team at NxtWave, with hands-on experience in
            building <span className="purple">Power BI</span> dashboards and
            driving data-informed operations. Previously worked on
            <span className="purple"> AI/ML</span> projects including employee
            burnout prediction and IoT security research.
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy solving problems end-to-end â€” across data, product, and operations.
